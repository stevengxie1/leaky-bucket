# Leaky Bucket

### Team
Author of the leaky bucket: Unknown

### Description

This is the leaky bucket. Or something to that effect.

### Steps to Run

The Makefile contains commands to test, build, and deploy

### TODOs:

- Tests need to be more comprehensive, include coverage reports
- Dockerfile could use more oomph: multistage build, pick a small, minimal runtime container
- Use Taskfile instead of Makefile
